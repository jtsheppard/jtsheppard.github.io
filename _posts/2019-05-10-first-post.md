This is my third week at Lambda school. It has been rough but rewarding. I am a part time student in the Data SCience Program and I feel like I am understanding more as we go but as we gone on, I have more questions. I guess it's true what Einstein said, “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.”
